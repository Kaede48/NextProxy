# NextProxy
NextProxy is a basic HTTP Proxy written in Rust. This project is to help me learn and understand the Rust language for future projects. This is currently an HTTP only proxy and not using HTTPS through TLS. I plan to incorporate the library of Rustls to allow the user to use an HTTPS proxy. 

As with any Rust project, you will need to compile it in order to run. The Cargo.toml file will have the dependencies you will need to in order to run NextProxy. 

This is mostly a plug and play install for any user who wants to use a basic proxy server locally.
